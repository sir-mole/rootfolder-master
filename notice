Here are some highly useful CSS tools that many developers enjoy using: [1]

CSS Grid Generator: This tool allows you to visually design CSS Grid layouts and export the code. It's great for prototyping without writing any code.
Autoprefixer: This PostCSS plugin parses your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to support features like gradients, transitions etc in different browsers. It saves a lot of time compared to manually adding prefixes.
Flexbox Defense: A fun game that teaches you CSS flexbox concepts by having you build mazes for a character using flex properties. A unique way to learn!
CSS Triggers: This Chrome extension lets you add interactive triggers to elements on a page that trigger CSS changes. Very useful for testing responsive designs.
UI Gradients: A nice collection of color gradients that you can copy and paste directly into your CSS. Saves hunting down the right gradient colors.
CSS Scan: This tool analyzes your CSS code and provides insights like unused selectors, properties etc. Helps clean up and optimize your stylesheets.
